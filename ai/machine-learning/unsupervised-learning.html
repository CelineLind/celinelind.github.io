    <h1>Unsupervised Learning - with KMeans Clustering</h1>
    <p>In unsupervised learning, we provide a model with unlabelled, unclassified data, and ask it to conduct some task 
        (such as clustering, dimension reduction, etc) from observing and analysing patterns in the data alone.
    </p>
    
    <h2>KMeans Clustering</h2>
    <p>KMeans is an unsupervised clustering algorithm.
        We provide the algorithm with the number of clusters (K) we would like it to group our data into -
        but we don't tell it how to group the data exactly. 
        It figures that out on its own from the patterns and structures in the data.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example below, select how many generated points of 2D data you would like to visualise. 
        Then, select how many clusters you would like KMeans to group the data into. 
        Additionally, tick the checkbox to randomise the data points each time. If left un-ticked, 
        a <i>seed</i> is used. This allows the data and cluster generation to be reproducable, as in, 
        when the same number of data points and clusters are used, the output 
        (location of data points and clusters) will always be same.

    <h3>KMeans Algorithm Explained</h3>
    <p>
        The KMeans algorithm is as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>Randomly initialise K mean points. 
                This means, randomly place the same number points on the graph 
                as you selected for the number of clusters (K). These are also called "means".
            </li>
            <li>
                For every data point on the graph, measure which of the mean points it is the closest to. 
                Label that data point, for now, as belonging to that meann point's cluster.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once all the data points have been labelled, 
                the algorithm will take the average point from all of those in a cluster, 
                and move that cluster's mean point to that average position on the graph. 
                Therefore, the mean point should now sit directly in the average middle 
                spot between all the points in it's cluster.
            </li>
            <li>
                Steps 2 and 3 are then repeated for a set number of times (in the example above, 100 times). 
                This results in the mean points for each cluster sitting as close to 
                the middle of each cluster as possible. Therefore, this clusters all the surrounding points 
                in accordance with which mean point they are closest to.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <!-- Insert example with same inputs 
        as above + number of iterations, 
        which plots with subplots for mean 
        points after every few iterations -->


    <h3>KMeans Real World Use Cases</h3>
    <h4 id="kmeans-image-segmentation">Image Segmentation with KMeans (Computer Vision)</h4>
    <p>KMeans can be used to locate items or parts of items in imagery and segment them out. 
        The same algorithm as above can be applied to imagery, as seen in the example below.
