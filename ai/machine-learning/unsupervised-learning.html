    <h1>Unsupervised Learning - with KMeans</h1>
    <p>KMeans is an unsupervised clustering algorithm.
        We provide the algorithm with the number of clusters we would like it to group our data into -
        but we don't tell it how to group the data exactly. 
        It figures that out on its own from the patterns and structures in the data.</p>
